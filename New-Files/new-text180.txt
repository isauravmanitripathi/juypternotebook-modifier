The code iterates over the range of the "summary_counter" variable, which represents the number of models for which summaries are stored. The goal is to separate each summary of the models clearly.

By using the loop variable "i," the code prints the summary of a specific model by accessing the corresponding index in the "summary" list. "print(summary[i])" displays the current model's summary information.

In order to distinguish between summaries of different models, the code prints a line of underscores after printing the summary. "print('________________________________________________________________________________________')" achieves this.

In addition, several line breaks are included to improve the readability of the printed output. "print('/n /n /n /n /n /n /n')" creates these line breaks.

Essentially, this code prints each summary from the stored summaries of different models. To improve readability, it adds a visual separator between each summary and includes line breaks. As a result, the model summaries are presented in a clear manner, making interpretation and comparison easier.

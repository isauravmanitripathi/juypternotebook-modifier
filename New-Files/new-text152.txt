  Our logistic regression model determines after five iterations, as can be seen from the summary. Based on the Log-Likelihood for our model and the Log-Likelihood of the null hypothesis, we can see that our model does not improve value prediction. Because the Log-Likelihood Ratio p-value does not reach the 5% margin of significance, we should not reject the null hypothesis (see Hastie et al.). The statsmodels Logit model calculated the /beta values and standard errors for all our independent variables in the list (2017). The standard error is the square root of the diagonal of the covariance matrix for the coefficients. The z value can be calculated as follows: z = /frac[coef][std / err] Some literature recommends a z value bigger than 2 or smaller than -2 to say that the variable brings enough To hold them (see Hastie et al. (2017)) We can see that none of our independent variables reaches this limit, and we can interpret the p-values in such a way as not to reject the null hypothesis (Hastie et al., 2017). (2017)) As expected, we have an extremely poorly functioning model with an accuracy of 52% on our test data set

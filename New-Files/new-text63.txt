Using the given code, a bar plot is generated to visualize the weights or loadings of the features in the second principal component.

The first step is to create the figure object, "fig," with a specific size defined by the argument [20,6]. Plot width and height are determined by this.

Using the "add_axes" method, an axes object, "ax," is added to the figure. In the figure, the argument [0,0,1,1] specifies the position and size of the axes. The axes should occupy the entire figure in this case.

There is a list of feature labels, "labl.". Input features to the PCA model are represented by these labels. A label corresponds to a specific variable or characteristic of the data.

By using the "components_" attribute, the weights or loadings of the features on the second principal component are obtained. Weights represent the contribution of each feature to the second principal component.

In order to create a bar plot, the "ax.bar" function is called. "labl" provides the x-axis labels, and "pc1" provides the heights of the bars.

The generated bar plot is displayed using the "plt.show()" function.

To visualize the weights or loadings of the features on the second principal component, the code generates a bar plot. According to the plot, each feature contributes to explaining the variation explained by the second principal component.

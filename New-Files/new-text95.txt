This code fits the previously defined grid search, "gsearch_rbf_all," to the training data in order to find the best hyperparameters for an SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF).

"fit" is called on the grid search object, passing the scaled training data "X_all_scaled_train" and the corresponding target variable "y_train".

To train and evaluate multiple SVM models, the grid search explores different combinations of hyperparameters specified in the parameter grid. The grid search performs cross-validation using the defined time series cross-validation scheme for each combination.

Several SVM models with different hyperparameter settings are trained and evaluated during the fitting process. Each model is evaluated according to the evaluation metric (such as accuracy or area under the curve) determined by the problem.

Across cross-validated models, the grid search selects the hyperparameters that maximize the performance metric. The grid search object contains the best hyperparameters and corresponding model performance after the fitting process has been completed.

A grid search object is fitted to the training data, allowing the search for optimal hyperparameters for an SVM model with an RBF kernel to begin. Using cross-validation, the grid search evaluates multiple model variations, considering different combinations of hyperparameters.

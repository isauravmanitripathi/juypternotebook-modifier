Each grid search uses different sets of training data to find the optimal hyperparameters for an SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

The "fit" method is called on each grid search object. "gsearch_rbf_all" fits the RBF SVM model using the entire training dataset scaled as "X_all_scaled_train" and the corresponding target variable "y_train."

In the remaining five grid searches, namely "gsearch_rbf_forward," "gsearch_rbf_backward," "gsearch_rbf_factors," "gsearch_rbf_returns," and "gsearch_rbf_pca," different subsets of training data were used to fit the RBF SVM model, along with the target variable "y_train."

The code allows evaluating the RBF SVM model under different feature representations or transformations by fitting these grid searches with different training data subsets. As a result, the most suitable training data subset or feature space can be identified based on the selected evaluation metric.

The code fits six different RBF SVM models with different sets of training data. Grid searches are fitted using a subset of the training data and the target variable. A RBF SVM model can be evaluated across various feature representations or transformations by fitting the models with different training data subsets.

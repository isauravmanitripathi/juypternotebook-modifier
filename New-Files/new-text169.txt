Recursive feature elimination (RFE) By selecting the best features in the last two steps, we were able to improve our model. The model's performance can be improved by reducing features (Hastie et al. The year 2017)

In order to select the best features for our model, we can use Sklearn's Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Its purpose is to perform a feature ranking for a defined estimator (logreg) by fitting the model and dropping the least important feature by a coefficient or a feature importance attribute. This process is repeated until the remaining features are of a given feature importance or until a specific number of features is dropped. By default, the RFE method reduces all features to half of We implement the method as follows and print the selection from the RFE

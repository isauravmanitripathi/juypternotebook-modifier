A DataFrame named df is used to calculate exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) for the 'ret' column.

First, the code adds a column named 'ret_ewma_5' to the DataFrame. The EWMA of the 'ret' column with a halflife of 5 is computed to create this column. By giving more weight to recent values and gradually decreasing the weight for older values, the EWMA calculates the average value of the 'ret' column. The 'ret_ewma_5' column represents the smoothed average of 'ret' with a shorter memory span, capturing recent trends and changes.

In the DataFrame df, another new column is added named 'ret_ewma_10'. Calculate the EWMA of the 'ret' column with a halflife of 10 to obtain this column. As with the 'ret_ewma_5' column, the 'ret_ewma_10' column represents the exponentially weighted average of the 'ret' values. Because of its longer halflife, it has a slightly longer memory. Using this column, you can get a smoother average that still responds to recent changes, but retains some influence from older values as well.

A third column is also created in the DataFrame df called 'ret_ewma_30'. Calculated from the EWMA of the 'ret' column with a halflife of 30. This column represents the exponentially weighted moving average of the 'ret' values over a longer period of time. The longer halflife of this column results in a smoother average, capturing longer-term trends while responding less to short-term fluctuations.

This code snippet calculates exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) for the 'ret' column in the DataFrame df. Using the .ewm().mean() method, it creates three new columns, 'ret_ewma_5', 'ret_ewma_10', and 'ret_ewma_30', representing smoothed averages of 'ret' over time. By using these columns, we can capture trends, smooth out noise, and identify longer-term patterns in the 'ret' data. Different halflife values allow for customizing the memory span and responsiveness to recent changes, which allows for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying data.

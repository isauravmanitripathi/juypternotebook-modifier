Data scaling is performed using the MinMaxScaler on two sets of data associated with a feature named "X_returns": "X_returns_train" and "X_returns_test."

The MinMaxScaler's "fit" method is called first with the input "X_returns_train". To scale the data, the minimum and maximum values of each feature in the training set are calculated and stored.

The "transform" method is then applied to "X_returns_train" using the MinMaxScaler previously fitted. The values of each feature in "X_returns_train" are scaled based on their calculated minimum and maximum values. "X_returns_scaled_train" stores the scaled data.

To ensure consistency in scaling, the same MinMaxScaler instance is employed again with the "transform" method on the test set "X_returns_test." "X_returns_scaled_test" stores the transformed test data.

The code determines each feature's minimum and maximum values by fitting the MinMaxScaler on the training set. Using the fitted scaler, it applies the scaling transformation to both training and test sets. Based on the characteristics of the training set, the values in both sets are scaled consistently within a specified range, typically between 0 and 1.

In this step, we import the packages and libraries we will use for importing and visualizing our data. NumPy provides us with matrix operations as well as numeric vectors. Using Pandas, we can use a DataFrame data type. A DataFrame enables easy data handling and is convenient to use. With MatPlotLib, we can plot graphs, while with Seaborn, we can make everything look nice.

There will not be a detailed explanation of every method we use. For more information, please refer to the official documentation.

An SVM model with a linear kernel is selected using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV).

The first step is to create an RFECV object, called "m_rfe.". An SVM model with a linear kernel is used as the estimator, and parameters such as cache size and class weight are configured. To evaluate the model's performance, "tscv" is also specified.

A RFECV object is then fitted to the training data, where "X_all_scaled_train" represents the input features and "y_train" represents the target variables. To identify the optimal subset of features that contribute the most to the model's performance, RFECV uses recursive feature elimination along with cross-validation.

Using the "get_support()" method of the RFECV object, the code retrieves the selected features. From the "X_all_train" dataset, these selected features are converted to a list and printed along with their corresponding names. According to the feature selection process, these features were considered important.

In the next step, the fitted RFECV model is used to predict the target variable for the test dataset, "X_all_scaled_test." The predicted values are stored in "y_pred_linear_rfe."

This code prints a classification report using the "classification_report" function, which displays metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. In the "digits" parameter, the number of decimal places is specified.

Lastly, the code prints the confusion matrix using the "confusion_matrix" function, which shows the number of samples correctly and incorrectly classified based on predicted and true labels.

The code performs feature selection using RFECV for an SVM model with a linear kernel. The RFECV object is fitted to the training data, the selected features are retrieved, predictions are made on the test data, and a classification report and confusion matrix are used to assess the model's performance.

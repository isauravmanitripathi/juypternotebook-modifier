As Random Forests are built from a variety of decision trees, they can be visualized easily. In order to see how the algorithm classified our data, let's choose one tree. Our visualization will be based on the graphviz functionality in SCKIT. We also recommend the library `dtreeviz` for the visualization and interpretation of decision trees. Due to the fact that this requires extra data processing steps, we will leave it out of this tutorial.

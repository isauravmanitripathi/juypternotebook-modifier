In the provided code snippet, rolling means are calculated for the 'ret' column in a DataFrame named df.

To begin with, the code adds a new column to the DataFrame df called 'ret_mean_5'. The rolling mean of the 'ret' column is calculated using a 5 window size for this column. Using the rolling mean, data is smoothed by calculating the average value of the 'ret' column for each row and the four preceding rows. Over this 5-row window, the 'ret_mean_5' column captures the average trend of the 'ret' values.

In the DataFrame df, a new column named 'ret_mean_10' is added. With a window size of 10, the rolling mean of the 'ret' column is calculated. In the same way as the 'ret_mean_5' column, the 'ret_mean_10' column represents the average value of the 'ret' column for each row and the nine rows preceding it. With a window size of 10, the rolling mean provides a smoother representation of the 'ret' values.

Using different window sizes, this code snippet calculates rolling means for the 'ret' column in the DataFrame df. The .rolling().mean() method creates two new columns, 'ret_mean_5' and 'ret_mean_10', which represent the average values of 'ret' over various window sizes. Rolling mean columns smooth out fluctuations in the 'ret' data and capture the overall trend or central tendency. This enables insights into longer-term patterns and trends by aggregating and smoothing data.

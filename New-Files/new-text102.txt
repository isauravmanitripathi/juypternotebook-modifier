With the given code, six grid searches are fitted, each aiming to find the optimal hyperparameters for a linear SVM model.

On each grid search object, the "fit" method is called. As the first grid search, "gsearch_linear_all," fits the model using the entire training dataset scaled as "X_all_scaled_train" and the corresponding target variable "y_train."

In the remaining five grid searches, "gsearch_linear_forward," "gsearch_linear_backward," "gsearch_linear_factors," "gsearch_linear_returns," and "gsearch_linear_pca," different subsets of training data, each scaled appropriately, and the target variable "y_train," the linear SVM model was fitted.

By fitting these grid searches with different training data subsets, we can explore the performance of linear SVM models under different feature representations. In terms of the selected evaluation metric, this can help identify the most appropriate training data subset or feature space.

Essentially, the code fits six linear SVM models with different sets of training data. A specific subset of the training data, along with the target variable, is used to fit each grid search. It allows evaluating the linear SVM model's performance across different feature representations or transformations by fitting the models with different training data subsets.

With the given code, four separate grid searches are performed, each aiming to find the optimal hyperparameters for a specific SVM model with a different kernel type: linear, RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid.

Grid search objects are defined for each kernel type using the "GridSearchCV" class. "estimator" specifies the SVM model with the specific kernel type: "model_linear" for linear, "model_rbf" for RBF, "model_poly" for polynomial, and "model_sigmoid" for sigmoid.

During grid search, the "cv" parameter is set to the time series cross-validation scheme, "tscv," which allows data to be split and evaluated in a time-dependent manner.

"param_grid" specifies the parameter grid for each kernel type: "param_grid_linear" for linear, "param_grid_rbf" for RBF and sigmoid (since they share the same parameter grid), and "param_grid_poly" for polynomial.

Grid search can be sped up by setting the "n_jobs" parameter to -1, allowing parallel fitting on all CPU cores.

There are four separate grid searches in the code, each targeting a different SVM model with a different kernel type. The grid searches explore different combinations of hyperparameters defined by their respective parameter grids. Time series cross-validation is used to train and evaluate the models, and grid searches are used to identify the best hyperparameters.

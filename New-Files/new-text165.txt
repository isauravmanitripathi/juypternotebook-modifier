It is again the LLR p-value that leads us to accept the null hypothesis rather than our model, but this time the qskew z value reached a significance margin of 2 and its p-value was smaller than 0.05, so we should conclude that the Feature and its coefficient contribute to the model and improve its performance.

We can see that there is still no real classification going on when we review the Accuracy on the test set, the time series cross validation score, and the confusion matrix again. For every observation in the test data, our model predicts a rising return. However, the ROC curve does not show any improvement in total.

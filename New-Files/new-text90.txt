To tune the hyperparameters of SVM models with different kernels, the code provides three parameter grids: "param_grid_linear," "param_grid_rbf," and "param_grid_poly."

A single parameter, 'C', represents the regularization parameter for the linear kernel in the "param_grid_linear" dictionary. 'C' values are generated using np.logspace(-10,4,14), which creates a sequence of 14 logarithmically spaced values between 10^-10 and 10^4. During hyperparameter optimization, these values will be tested to determine the optimal linear kernel 'C' value.

The "param_grid_rbf" dictionary is used for both the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the sigmoid kernel. There are two parameters in this equation: 'C' and 'gamma'. 'C' represents the regularization parameter, and 'gamma' represents the Gaussian kernel width. C and Gamma are generated using np.logspace(-10,4,14), resulting in 14 logarithmically spaced values between 10^-10 and 10^4. For RBF and sigmoid kernels, these values will be explored during hyperparameter optimization.

Three parameters are included in the "param_grid_poly" dictionary for the polynomial kernel: 'C', 'gamma', and 'degree'. 'C' and 'gamma' are generated using np.logspace(-2,1,4) and np.logspace(-3,1,5), respectively, resulting in four and five values, respectively. A fixed value of 2 is set for the 'degree' parameter. During hyperparameter optimization, these parameter combinations will be evaluated to identify the best polynomial kernel 'C', 'gamma', and 'degree' values.

The code sets up parameter grids for hyperparameter tuning of linear, RBF/sigmoid, and polynomial SVM models. For each kernel type, these grids define the range of potential values for the regularization parameter ('C'), Gaussian kernel width ('gamma'), and polynomial degree ('degree').

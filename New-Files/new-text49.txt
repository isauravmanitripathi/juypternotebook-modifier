We can see from the table above that the features have very different scales, and some are orders of magnitude apart.

Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression, which we use, are sensitive to feature scale. SVMs, for example, are highly sensitive to the scale of features (Zheng et al., 2018).

If the features are not scaled, the features with large values will dominate other features, harming the performance of the model.

Random forests, however, are not sensitive to input scale in tree-based machine learning models.

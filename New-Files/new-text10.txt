We have financial variables from January 2004 to July 2017. Our conditioning variables can be divided into three categories. Our seminar thesis provides an in-depth explanation of what these variables mean, since we are focusing on the application of machine learning to finance.

Observations: $ N = 3303 $ <br> Aspects: $ p = 14

Our features can be divided into two categories:

The first. Looking ahead:

  *  Risk-free rate
  *  $SVIX^2$  as the risk-neutral variance 
  *  Risk-neutral skewness
  *  Risk-neutral kurtosis 

The second. Backward-looking: S&P 500 return, Market return, Cost return, Value return,  Momentum return

  Variations in their 10 day rolling window

Bloomberg provides us with daily return values for the S&P 500. The other factors were taken from [Kenneth French's website](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_factors.html).

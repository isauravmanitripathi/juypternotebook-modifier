It is also important to measure performance in multiclass classification using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) curve (see Bradley (1996)). In order to visualize our curve, we will use a matplotlib plot to visualize our y_test set and our predicted values for our x_test set. We will also initialize a variable summary_counter and a list summary in order to get a summary of all our tries at the end of this chapter. For this estimator, we will store our results

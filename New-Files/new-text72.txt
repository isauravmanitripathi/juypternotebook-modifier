Using the provided code, a bar chart visualization of time series cross-validation (TSCV) is generated.

The code defines the number of splits, "tscv_splits," which determines how the data will be divided for cross-validation into folds or subsets.

"Split_size" is calculated by dividing 70% of the 'ret' column in the DataFrame 'df' by the number of splits.

In the following steps, three lists are initialized: 'train_data,' 'test_data,' and 'bar_label.' These lists are initially filled with zeros, and their lengths are equal to 'tscv_splits' minus one.

Based on the split sizes, a loop populates the 'train_data,' 'test_data,' and 'bar_label' lists with appropriate values. It assigns the corresponding values to each element of the list from 0 to the length of 'train_data'.

After formatting adjustments are made to the 'bar_label' list, the elements are converted to integers and assigned string labels.

Using the 'figsize' argument, the code creates a figure and axes object for the plot.

By using the axes object, the code generates two sets of bars on the plot: one for training and one for validation. Using the 'autolbl' function, each bar is labeled with the corresponding split size.

For the plot, additional formatting is applied to the axes labels, title, and legend.

The plot is displayed using the 'plt.show()' function.

This code generates a bar chart that illustrates a time series cross-validation scheme. A visual representation of how cross-validation data is partitioned for training and validation is provided by the size of training and validation data for each split.

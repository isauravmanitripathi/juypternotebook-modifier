Using the provided code snippet, several new columns are created in a DataFrame named df by shifting the values of the existing column 'ret'.

In the first step, a new column named 'ret-1' is added to the DataFrame df. By shifting the values of the 'ret' column backwards, this column is created. The 'ret-1' column corresponds to the previous row's 'ret' value.

The code then creates a new column named 'ret-2' in the DataFrame. The values of the 'ret' column are shifted two positions backward to produce this column. The 'ret-2' column represents the 'ret' value from two rows ago.

In the same way, the code continues to create new columns. A 'ret-3' column is added by shifting the values of 'ret' three positions backward, a 'ret-4' column by shifting the values four positions backward, and a 'ret-5' column by shifting the values five positions backward.

DataFrame df includes the original 'ret' column as well as newly created 'ret-1', 'ret-2', 'ret-3', 'ret-4', and 'ret-5' columns. From one to five rows ago, these additional columns represent the historical values of 'ret'.

By shifting the values of the 'ret' column backwards, this code snippet adds several new columns to the DataFrame df. The new columns represent the 'ret' values from a specific number of rows ago, ranging from one row ago ('ret-1') to five rows ago ('ret-5'). Shifting or lagging column values can be useful for time series analysis or for incorporating historical information into features.

On a forward-looking dataset, this code applies logistic regression modeling. Using the forward-looking data, we will build a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and store the evaluation results.

Using a min-max scaler, the code applies feature scaling to the input features "X_forward". A scaler is fitted to "X_forward" to learn the scaling parameters, and then "X_forward" is transformed into "X_forward_scaled". We convert the transformed data into a DataFrame and set the column names to match the original "X_forward" columns.

In the statsmodels library, the "sm.Logit" class is used to create a logistic regression model. Model inputs include the target variable "y_logit" and the scaled input data "X_forward_scaled". For convergence, 50 iterations are allowed. Using the "fit" method, the logistic regression model is fitted to the data, and the results are saved in "result_sns".

"print(result_sns.summary())" prints the summary of the fitted logistic regression model. An overview of the model's coefficients, statistical significance, and goodness of fit can be found here.

Using the training data "X_forward_scaled_train" and the corresponding target labels "y_train", a logistic regression model is fitted from scikit-learn. A model is stored in the "model_list" at the specified index "model_counter".

A logistic regression model is then used to predict the test data "X_forward_scaled_test", and the predicted labels are stored in "y_pred".

"print" prints the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier on the test set. A logistic regression model's "score" method is used to calculate the accuracy score.

Using the "cross_val_score" function, the logistic regression model is cross-validated. Using the specified time series splitting strategy "tscv", it uses the training data "X_forward_scaled_train" and the target labels "Y_train". Each fold is scored, and the average accuracy across all folds is displayed.

Using the predicted labels "y_pred" and the true labels "y_test", the confusion matrix is calculated. In the confusion matrix, the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class is shown.

It is possible to print and display the accuracy, classification report, and ROC curve plot with the corresponding AUC score by using the "print" and "plt" functions.

In the summary list, the evaluation results are summarized. Concatenated with relevant labels and formatting are the counter for the model list and summary information, including the logistic regression model summary, accuracy, cross-validation average accuracy, classification report, and AUC score. A summary is stored in the summary list at the index indicated by the summary counter. In subsequent iterations, the summary counter is incremented.

This code performs logistic regression modeling on forward-looking data. The model fits a logistic regression model using both statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries, makes predictions, and evaluates its performance using accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve analysis. For further analysis and comparison, evaluation results are stored in a summary list.

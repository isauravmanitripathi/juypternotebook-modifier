It can be quite overwhelming to deal with this. The Scikit-Learn documentation says that the most important settings are n_estimators and max_features. When looking for the best split, these points indicate the number of trees in a forest and the number of features to consider. For every problem, it is difficult to determine the best parameters. We're trying out a variety of settings to see what works. In the same way as we did with the SVM, we will create a Parameter grid for this.

Almost every falling return is predicted as rising in our model, as expected. Our method classification_report gives an overview of our model by calculating its precision, recall and f1 score on the test data. The recall is simply how likely the estimator is to find all positive samples for both results. F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Test data support is the number of rising and falling results.

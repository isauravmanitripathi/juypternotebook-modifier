This code initializes a MinMaxScaler object called "minmaxscaler".

Data preprocessing techniques such as MinMaxScaler are commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. In a dataset, it is used to map numeric features into a specified range, usually between 0 and 1.

As a result, the MinMaxScaler subtracts the minimum value of the feature, then divides by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. It preserves the relative relationships and proportions between the original values while ensuring that the transformed values fall within the desired range.

The code creates an instance of the MinMaxScaler class to enable the subsequent use of its methods and functionalities to perform the scaling operation. A scaler object can be utilized to preprocess features or variables before feeding them into a machine learning model, ensuring that they are appropriately scaled and improving accuracy.

Based on a model's predicted labels and the test set's true labels, this code prints a classification report. A comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance is provided, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

From a relevant library, the code uses the "classification_report" function. Inputs are the true labels "y_test" and predicted labels "y_pred".

A report summarizing each class's performance metrics is generated by the "classification_report" function. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are included in the report. Among all positive predictions for a given class, precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions. Based on all actual positive instances, recall calculates the proportion of true positive predictions. An F1-score measures the model's accuracy by balancing precision and recall. Support represents the number of instances of each class in the test data.

Using the "print" statement, the code prints the classification report. It includes the aforementioned metrics for each class, as well as an overall average of the model's performance.

Essentially, this code generates and displays the classification report, which provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class in the test data. Classification reports are useful for assessing the model's accuracy, identifying areas for improvement, and understanding its performance.

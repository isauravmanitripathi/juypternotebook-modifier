What are Decision Trees? Decision trees divide inputs according to rules. A decision tree begins with a root node. If a certain feature exceeds or falls below a certain threshold, this node makes a binary decision. Upon reaching this threshold, every data point is classified and assigned to a new node. Every data point classified belongs to only one class after this process of subdivison is repeated on all children of the respective node. (2017) (Hastie et al.)

Regression and non-numerical data can also be handled by Decision Trees. We will stick to classification in this example.

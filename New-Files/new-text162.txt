The AUC value shows how well the model can distinguish between classes. In plain English: the higher the AUC value, the better it is at classifying rising or falling returns. In the ROC curve, the true positive rate (TPR) is plotted against the false positive rate (FPR), with the TPR axis being on the y-axis and the FPR on the x-axis. In the Legend, Logistic Regression (area=0.50) indicates a 0.50 AUC. As mentioned above, we can also rely on a coin tos Calculate the return on investment

As "model_randomforest_allData," this code prints the out-of-bag score of a trained Random Forest classifier.

During the training process, the OOB score is calculated to determine the classifier's accuracy. Based on the non-bootstrap samples used to train each decision tree in the Random Forest, it estimates how well the classifier will perform on unseen data.

This code provides information about the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier on unseen data by printing the OOB score. A model's OOB score serves as an internal validation metric that helps assess generalization performance without the need for additional validation data.

Based on the samples not used during training, the code prints an estimate of the accuracy of a trained Random Forest classifier on unseen data.

Using a random selection of variables (features), Decision Trees are created. The number of trees can also be selected. Here, we will examine how modifying these parameters will affect accuracy.

To obtain comparable results, we will also use TimeSeriesSplit Cross Validation.

Let's see what parameters are currently set. We can print out the currently used parameters using the method get_params().
